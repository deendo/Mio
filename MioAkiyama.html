                    style="color: 943F9C; text-decoration: none;">K-ON!</a>
                    She is a passionate and technical left-handed musician and writer who serves as the bassist, 
                    second vocalist and main lyricist of the band <a href="https://k-on.fandom.com/wiki/Ho-kago_Tea_Time" 
                    style="color: 943F9C; text-decoration: none;">Ho-kago Tea Time</a>. She is a kind and warm girl, 
                    albeit very shy and sensitive. Despite her timid streak she often finds herself as 
                    the voice of reason amongst her bandmates, who often rely on her sensibility when in trouble. .

                <p style="font-size: larger;">
                    Mio is very reserved and bashful by nature. She is private and soft-spoken, even amongst close friends, and seems to enjoy time alone, 
                    which she often dedicates to songwriting. She has been socially anxious and self-conscious since she was small, hence falling prey to a
                    young Ritsu's teasing, and typically retreated into the sanctuary of her books. She struggles to interact with strangers, has few friends 
                    outside the Light Music Club (despite her popularity), and is strikingly sensitive to attention from others. She also embarrasses very easily
                    and does not easily live down mortifying moments. Her bandmates' antics and jokes are hence often at her expense. Mio specifically chose the bass 
                    guitar as her instrument because it is not as conspicuous as the guitar.
                    <br><br>
                    Mio is diligent, responsible, and sober, especially when contrasted with her happy-go-lucky bandmates. She is academically inclined, always ranking
                    within the top 10 students of her grade, and a keen reader and writer. She is a very dedicated musician and is technically advanced at the bass guitar.
                    She is very driven when it comes to the Light Music Club and, in her own words, is committed to the club as if it were her boyfriend. She even takes over 
                    lead vocals from Yui when she needs to, despite strongly preferring to solely play bass. Her bandmates often turn to her when faced with academic troubles 
                    or when curious about musical technique.

                <p style="font-size: larger;">
                    Mio is a bassist above all, cherishing her instrument’s low-end tone, her role as the band’s harmonic and rhythmic support, and her smaller share 
                    of the spotlight. Mio is a very proficient musician and composer, evidently skilled at both fingerstyle and pick-use. She is no stranger to playing 
                    at high and variable speeds or active movement along the fretboard and is consistent at keeping time, even making up for the energetic Ritsu’s rhythmic 
                    inconsistencies. She sparingly incorporates slapping, popping, chords, pull-offs, tapping, and harmonics, but proves to be skilled at each of these techniques. 
                    Mio is also a left-handed player.
                    <br><br>
                    Mio appears to truly be in her element most when the vocal responsibilities lie with Yui and “Elizabeth” is given her undivided attention. Mio’s bass playing 
                    is more rhythmically and melodically progressive, and technically demanding during songs that demand less of her voice such as 
                    <a href="https://k-on.fandom.com/wiki/GO!_GO!_MANIAC_(Song)"style="color: 943F9C; text-decoration: none;">"Go! Go! Maniac!"</a>.

                <p style="font-size: larger;">
                    Despite her initial reluctance to stand in the spotlight, Mio’s bright and earnest singing certainly does justice to her meticulous songwriting.
                    Mio is a soprano and her vocal range and power are demonstrated in songs such as <a href="https://k-on.fandom.com/wiki/Don%27t_say_%22lazy%22_(Song)" 
                    style="color: 943F9C; text-decoration: none;">‘Don’t Say “Lazy”’</a>. Mio’s warmer and rounder vocals also nicely 
                    complement Yui’s voice, which is generally higher and lighter. The interplay and chemistry between the two singers are very prevalent in songs such as 
                    <a href="https://k-on.fandom.com/wiki/Fuwa_Fuwa_Time_(Song)" style="color: 943F9C; text-decoration: none;">“Fuwa Fuwa Time”</a>.
